A micro-RTS game with simple dots. The yellow circles can (a)ttack, (h)arvest, (b)uild, or 
remain (i)dle by pressing their respectful buttons on the keyboard. They also flee automatically 
if health drops below 0.5. Big orange circles are bases, cyan circles are resources. The green 
can hurt if they decide to.
